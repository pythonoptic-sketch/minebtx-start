# Onboarding

## Why pool here first

Before the install steps, a one-screen summary of what you're buying into
by pointing your hashrate at DEXBTX:

- **Variance smoothing.** A 5070-class card solo-mines a BTX block every
  4-7 days *on average* but variance is brutal (3-week droughts happen).
  PPLNS pays you per-share against a rolling 10K-share window, so your
  income tracks your hashrate instead of your luck.
- **Block propagation that wins races.** BTX's P2P mesh is small and
  slow. We run a dedicated **block-forwarder** with ancestor-push that
  injects every win straight into the highest-connectivity peers the
  millisecond the solver returns — taking our fleet orphan rate from
  ~38% (raw internet routing) down to under 5%. You inherit that
  propagation just by pointing your miner at us.
- **Pre-tuned peer mesh.** Our pool node maintains a curated regional
  peer graph across NA / EU / SEA / AU. You don't spend the first week
  hunting non-stalling peers; templates route through ours by default.
- **Failure modes already paved over.** A year of running a 7-rental
  fleet uncovered shielded-state corruption after reorg storms, btxd
  hangs on slow peer block-body delivery, tailscaled crashes in
  userspace containers, CUDA buffer-pool exhaustion at batch=256, and
  silent CPU fallback (mining at 1/1000th throughput for weeks
  unnoticed). The installer's hard CUDA-engagement smoke test plus the
  miner's reconnect backoff + daemon respawn cover all of those.
- **Simplicity.** Solo mining = run your own btxd (600 GB chainstate,
  manual peer wrangling, manual restart after reorg storms). Pooled
  mining = `curl | bash | mine`. One binary, one YAML, one tmux.
- **Transparent pool economics.** 2.5% fee, weekly Friday 18:00 UTC
  batched payouts, no minimum-payout threshold beyond the network dust
  floor. Pool treasury + fee receiving addresses published on the
  dashboard.

## Pick your starting point

Three paths into the pool, in order of audience size:

| You are… | Path |
|---|---|
| **Fresh starter** — empty Linux box, never mined BTX before | [Start here](#fresh-starter-empty-box) |
| **Converter** — already solo-mining BTX, want to pool instead | [Start here](#converter-already-solo-mining) |
| **Self-hoster** — running your own btxd, want pool-mining alongside it | [Start here](#self-hoster-pool-mining-alongside-your-own-btxd) |

All three paths end at the **same one-liner**. Read on for why even converters should re-run it.

---

## Fresh starter (empty box)

You have a Linux machine with an NVIDIA GPU (Pascal GTX 1070 through Blackwell RTX 5090) and nothing BTX-related installed yet.

### Prerequisites

- Linux (Ubuntu 22.04+ tested; other distros likely work) or macOS, or Windows via WSL2
- NVIDIA driver ≥ 565 (`nvidia-smi --query-gpu=driver_version --format=csv,noheader`)
- ~500 MB free disk
- Stable internet route to `stratum.minebtx.com:3333` (no Tailscale or VPN required)
- A BTX payout address — see [Getting a BTX address](#getting-a-btx-address) below if you don't have one

### Install (one command)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://pythonoptic-sketch.github.io/minebtx-start/install.sh | bash -s -- --address 'btx1z…YOUR_BTX_ADDRESS…'
```

That's it. The script:

1. **Detects your GPU** (`nvidia-smi --query-gpu=name`) and picks the matched profile from the per-card table — see [TUNING.md](TUNING.md)
2. **Installs Python 3.10+ and `pyyaml`** if missing (`apt-get install` on Debian/Ubuntu; manual instructions printed otherwise)
3. **Downloads `btx-gbt-solve`** as a GitHub release asset, SHA256-verifies against the value pinned in `pyproject.toml`, refuses to proceed on mismatch
4. **Runs a hard GPU-acceleration smoke test** (Phase 0.3b): asserts the solver appears in `nvidia-smi --query-compute-apps`, draws >100 W sustained, and exceeds 1000 N/s throughput. Fails LOUDLY if CUDA didn't actually engage — catches silent CPU fallback that would otherwise mine at 1/1000th speed without you noticing
5. **Writes** `~/.dexbtx-miner/config.yaml` with your address, the GPU's tuned profile, and stratum endpoint
6. **Installs the `dexbtx-miner` Python orchestrator** (this repo) via `pip install --user dexbtx-miner`

### Run

```bash
dexbtx-miner --config ~/.dexbtx-miner/config.yaml
```

Or as a persistent tmux session:

```bash
tmux new -d -s dexbtx 'dexbtx-miner --config ~/.dexbtx-miner/config.yaml 2>&1 | tee -a ~/.dexbtx-miner/miner.log'
tmux attach -t dexbtx
```

You should see `share OK` lines in the log within a minute. Now [pick a stable worker name](#worker-naming-and-mining-visibility).

---

## Converter (already solo-mining)

You're already mining BTX solo with your own btxd and `btx-gbt-solve`. You want to point your hashrate at the pool instead.

**You should run the same install.sh as fresh starters.** Here's why — solo-mining-era setups have several incompatibilities with the pool-mining path that the installer fixes for you:

| Component | Solo-mining era (your current setup) | Pool-mining required |
|---|---|---|
| `btx-gbt-solve` binary | Often pre-v4.0 — missing `--share-target` + `--daemon` flags | v4.3+ with `--share-target` (pool early-exit) and `--daemon` (persistent solver, eliminates per-slice CUDA-context-init cost) |
| Solver kernel for your GPU | Pascal-only sm_61 native; PTX-JIT to everything else | Native cubins for sm_61 + sm_89 + sm_90 + sm_120 (Pascal + Ada + Hopper + Blackwell). Turing/Ampere still PTX-JIT |
| `BTX_MATMUL_GPU_INPUTS` | Often unset → defaults to `1` (GPU-generated inputs) | `0` (CPU-generated). Mandatory — without this every modern GPU caps at ~8% util / 33 W |
| Tuning profile | `BTX_MATMUL_PREPARE_WORKERS=8`, `SOLVER_THREADS=4`, `BATCH=32` (old Pascal-era defaults) | `PREPARE_WORKERS=16`, `SOLVER_THREADS=8`, `BATCH=128` — universal across Pascal through Blackwell. **Sustained `workers=16` is the lever that takes a 5070 from 70% util to 100%** |
| Env-var names you might have set | `BTX_MATMUL_PREFETCH`, `BTX_MATMUL_BATCH_SIZE` (don't exist) | `BTX_MATMUL_PREPARE_PREFETCH_DEPTH`, `BTX_MATMUL_SOLVE_BATCH_SIZE` (the actual names). Wrong names are silent no-ops |
| Orchestrator | `btx-gbt-miner.py` (solo-mining, polls your local btxd) | `dexbtx-miner` (stratum client, drives the solver in daemon mode) |
| Stratum protocol | n/a | Pool stratum v1 with matmul-extended job format |

**The install.sh handles ALL of this for you.** It downloads the right binary, writes the right config, verifies CUDA actually engages, and points everything at the pool.

If you really want to do it by hand instead, see [Manual converter recipe](#manual-converter-recipe) below — but unless you have a non-standard setup you really need to preserve, just run the one-liner.

### Will install.sh disturb my existing setup?

Mostly no:

- ✅ Installs new files under `~/.dexbtx-miner/` — doesn't touch your existing `~/.btx`, `/root/.btx`, or any other btxd datadir
- ✅ Installs `dexbtx-miner` Python package under `pip --user` — doesn't conflict with system Python
- ✅ Idempotent — re-running upgrades to latest, preserves your existing config.yaml (with `--yes` it backs up the old)
- ⚠️ Replaces the solver binary at `~/.dexbtx-miner/bin/btx-gbt-solve`. If you had a custom solver at that exact path, it gets overwritten. If your solo solver is elsewhere (e.g. `/usr/local/bin`, your build dir), no conflict

### After install.sh: stopping your solo mining

If you want to fully convert (stop solo mining, only pool-mine):

```bash
# Stop your solo orchestrator
pkill -f btx-gbt-miner.py    # if you use the legacy Python orchestrator
# Or whatever you use to drive your solo solver

# Optional: keep btxd running anyway — it's useful as a local validation node + peer
# even if you're not solo-mining (and you can switch back to solo by stopping
# dexbtx-miner and re-starting your orchestrator)
```

If you want to mine **both** solo AND pool — see [Self-hoster](#self-hoster-pool-mining-alongside-your-own-btxd) below; you can run both, but only one can have the GPU at a time.

### Manual converter recipe

For users who want full control (or have an exotic setup):

1. Build (or download) the v4.3+ `btx-gbt-solve` binary with both `--share-target` AND `--daemon` flags. Verify:
   ```bash
   btx-gbt-solve --help | grep -E "share-target|daemon"
   # Both must be present
   ```
2. Verify the binary has the right native cubins (Pascal sm_61 mandatory; sm_89/90/120 if you have those cards):
   ```bash
   cuobjdump --list-elf btx-gbt-solve
   ```
3. Install dexbtx-miner: `pip install --user dexbtx-miner` (or `pip install --user -e .` from this repo)
4. Write `~/.dexbtx-miner/config.yaml` — copy [config.example.yaml](../config.example.yaml) and edit `payout_address` + `worker_name`. Pick the right tuning profile from [TUNING.md](TUNING.md) for your card
5. Run: `dexbtx-miner --config ~/.dexbtx-miner/config.yaml`

---

## Self-hoster (pool-mining alongside your own btxd)

You run your own btxd and want to pool-mine while keeping the node up for sovereignty / peer-graph / dashboard / whatever.

**Run the same install.sh.** It doesn't touch your btxd or its datadir. Both can run simultaneously:

- `btxd` keeps doing its thing (full node, peering, RPC for your local tools)
- `dexbtx-miner` drives `btx-gbt-solve` against the pool stratum

The only conflict point is the GPU itself — if you were ALSO solo-mining (driving the solver yourself with `btx-gbt-miner.py` against your local btxd's `getmatmulchallenge`), you need to stop that, because two processes can't share the same GPU efficiently. Pool-mining wins on share variance for almost all card classes (especially below 5-10% network share).

### Reading peer recommendations from the pool

If your btxd is struggling for peers (the public DNS seeds are spotty), pull the pool's curated list:

```bash
curl -s https://stratum.minebtx.com/api/peer_list \
  | jq -r '.peers[].addr' \
  | xargs -I {} btx-cli addnode {} add
```

The list is filtered to peers on the current consensus subver, on the pool's tip, and not blacklisted. Use `?relaxed=true` if you want all observed peers (e.g. for diversity / regional clustering) instead of just the recommended subset.

---

## Getting a BTX address

If you don't have a BTX address yet, you need a wallet. Options:

- **Run your own btxd:** clone the BTX repo, build, `btx-cli getnewaddress` returns a transparent `btx1z…` address
- **Use the wallet guide:** the BTX Start page links the current wallet setup
  notes and keeps address generation separate from mining setup.

A valid pool payout address looks like `btx1z` followed by ~58 alphanumeric characters. It's a witness-v2 (P2MR) address that uses the post-quantum signature scheme — that's why it's longer than a Bitcoin address.

---

## Worker naming and mining visibility

The `worker_name` field in your config controls how your rig appears in logs
and future dashboard views.

### Naming convention

- **Allowed characters:** alphanumeric, `-`, `_`. Keep it short — stratum has a string length cap.
- **Recommended pattern:** `<alias>-<gpu>-<country2>-<color>` (four dash-separated parts, all lowercase):
  - `<alias>` — your nickname for this rig (any handle; **don't use your real name**)
  - `<gpu>` — short GPU model: `1070`, `2080ti`, `3060ti`, `4060ti`, `5070`, `5070ti`, …
  - `<country2>` — ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code: `us`, `de`, `ca`, `gb`, `jp`, …
  - `<color>` — a short, unique-to-you suffix to disambiguate multiple identical rigs
  - **Examples:** `kappa-5060ti-us-blue`, `bravo-1070-de-red`, `tango-4060ti-ca-green`
- **Why the country + color tail?** Two miners both running 5060 Tis in the US would otherwise collide on `home-5060ti`. The country + color keeps worker rows easier to read and filter.
- **Uniqueness scope:** the pool keys workers on `(payout_address, worker_name)`, so your `kappa-5060ti-us-blue` doesn't collide with someone else's *payout address*. The convention exists for the **dashboard** view, which lists workers across all addresses.
- **Stable identity:** changing the name creates a new worker row in the pool DB. Earned shares stay with the old name (PPLNS doesn't migrate). Pick one and stick with it.

### Visibility flow

1. **Pick a worker_name** and add it to your `~/.dexbtx-miner/config.yaml`
2. **Start mining** — `dexbtx-miner --config ~/.dexbtx-miner/config.yaml`. The pool creates a worker row the first time you submit a share
3. **Watch local proof of work** with `tail -f ~/.dexbtx-miner/miner.log` and
   `watch -n 2 nvidia-smi`
4. **Compare expected yield** on the BTX Start GPU ranking table. Your real
   payout tracks accepted shares, pool luck, and the backend payout cycle.

### What if I have multiple workers?

Keep each worker name stable and distinct:

```text
kappa-1070-us-blue
kappa-5070-us-red
kappa-4060ti-us-green
```

The future dashboard should roll workers up by payout address so a single
wallet can show all rigs together.

---

## Verify it's working

After the miner has been running for >1 minute:

```bash
# 1. Daemon alive (single long-running process)
pgrep -af "btx-gbt-solve.*--daemon"
# → one PID

# 2. CUDA actually engaged
nvidia-smi --query-compute-apps=pid,process_name,used_memory --format=csv,noheader
# → should list btx-gbt-solve

# 3. GPU util at target
nvidia-smi --query-gpu=utilization.gpu,power.draw --format=csv,noheader
# → ≥95% util for non-Pascal; ≥80% for Pascal (memory-bound — TUNING.md)

# 4. Shares being accepted
grep -cE 'share OK' ~/.dexbtx-miner/miner.log
# → counter ticking up

# 5. No persistent rejections or daemon I/O errors
grep -E 'share REJECTED|daemon I/O failed|unexpected daemon' ~/.dexbtx-miner/miner.log | tail -5
# → A few `share REJECTED` lines right after startup (codes 21/22/23) are
#   normal post-reconnect noise. They should stop within 1-2 minutes. If
#   they persist past 3 minutes, see the rejection-codes table at the
#   bottom of this doc.
```

If accepted shares continue and your GPU remains engaged, you are contributing
to the pool. Wallet balance visibility depends on the payout backend and your
own BTX wallet until BTX Start ships a first-party per-wallet dashboard.

## Operational notes

### Pool fee
2.5% of each block reward goes to the pool treasury (transparently published on the dashboard). The remaining 97.5% distributes via PPLNS over the most recent 10,000 shares.

### Payouts
Every Friday 18:00 UTC. Single batched multi-output transaction (low on-chain fee per recipient). No minimum threshold — only the network dust floor (10K sats ≈ 0.0001 BTX). Below dust, your balance rolls over to the next week.

### Variance
At small pool share, expect drought windows of 1–3 days between block finds.
Pool share grows with the miner count; use the BTX Start network snapshot for
current aggregate signals.

### Security: plaintext stratum & payout-address rewriting (v1 caveat)
The v1 stratum endpoint at `stratum.minebtx.com:3333` is **plaintext TCP** — there is no TLS yet. On a hostile network (open Wi-Fi, untrusted ISP, MITM-able LAN), an on-path attacker could rewrite the `mining.authorize` message and substitute their own `btx1z…` payout address for yours — your hashrate would credit them, not you. TLS is on the immediate roadmap (Caddy TCP-proxy + cert). Until then, treat the network path between your miner and the pool as something you need to actually trust. If you're on a residential ISP or datacenter rental on a known network, this is fine in practice; if you're on a coffee-shop Wi-Fi, mine somewhere else.

### How the pool de-conflicts nonce space across miners (technical aside)
Every miner connects with the same `nonce_start=0` and grinds the same nominal nonce range. Why do they not collide on duplicate work? Because the pool gives each connection a **unique `extranonce1`** at subscribe time, then bakes that extranonce into the per-worker coinbase, then sends each worker a *pre-built* `merkle_root` in the `mining.notify`. Two workers searching `nonce=0..N` are computing matmul digests against *different* `merkle_root` inputs — so they're scanning genuinely different digest spaces despite using the same nonce range.

What this means in practice:
- You don't need to configure or coordinate anything; it just works.
- If you see a flood of `code 22 — duplicate share` rejections post-reconnect, the pool re-handed you the same extranonce1 across sessions (rare; expected during pool-server restarts). Self-corrects within 1-2 minutes.
- If the pool ever fails to send a per-worker `merkle_root` (protocol bug), the client will reject the notify rather than mine on an empty merkle — the patched solver requires the field.

### Want to switch back to solo?
`dexbtx-miner` is pool-only. For solo mining, use the upstream
`btx-gbt-miner.py` from the BTX source tree — it speaks GBT directly
to a local `btxd` and skips stratum entirely.

## Common rejection codes (post-install hiccups)

| Pool error code | Meaning | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| 21 — `job stale (>180s)` | Your slice took too long; submitted past the 180s freshness window | Normal post-reconnect noise. Drops to zero once stratum settles |
| 22 — `duplicate share` | Same nonce was already submitted (often during reconnect-replay) | Self-corrects within 1-2 min |
| 23 — `digest >= share_target` | Pool difficulty changed mid-job | Self-corrects on next `notify` |
| 27 — `bad seeds` | Your solver's matmul consensus params don't match the pool's (rare — would indicate a network upgrade you missed) | Re-run `install.sh` to get the latest binary |

If `share OK` lines never appear and you're getting these continuously past the first 2 minutes, file an issue with the last 50 log lines.
